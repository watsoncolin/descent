## üöß Phase 1 - Core Proof (Critical Missing Features)

**Goal**: "Is mining fun?" - Need polish and feedback systems

### HIGH PRIORITY - Breaks Core Experience

#### 1. Fuel Warning System ‚ùå MISSING
**Status**: No warnings implemented at all
**Design**: FUEL_SYSTEM.md specifies 3 warning stages
**Impact**: Players run out of fuel with no warning (frustrating!)

**Needs:**
- [ ] **Low Fuel Warning (25% remaining)**
  - [ ] Fuel bar turns yellow
  - [ ] HUD message: "LOW FUEL"
  - [ ] Soft beep every 5 seconds
- [ ] **Critical Fuel Warning (10% remaining)**
  - [ ] Fuel bar turns red and flashes
  - [ ] HUD message: "CRITICAL FUEL - RETURN NOW"
  - [ ] Screen edges pulse yellow
  - [ ] Continuous warning alarm
- [ ] **Emergency Fuel Warning (5% remaining)**
  - [ ] Fuel bar flashing red rapidly
  - [ ] Large center screen warning
  - [ ] Urgent alarm sound

#### 2. Emergency Return System ‚ùå COMPLETELY MISSING
**Status**: Not implemented - fuel depletion = instant game over
**Design**: FUEL_SYSTEM.md requires auto-ascent with 50% cargo penalty
**Impact**: Breaks core risk/reward balance - too punishing

**Needs:**
- [ ] Trigger when fuel reaches 0
- [ ] Auto-ascent at 5 m/sec (slow upward float)
- [ ] "Emergency Return in Progress" UI overlay
- [ ] Countdown timer showing ETA to surface
- [ ] Apply 50% cargo penalty (drop half minerals)
- [ ] Show cargo loss indicator
- [ ] Can still take hull damage during ascent
- [ ] Disable player control during return

**CRITICAL**: This changes fail state from "lose everything" to "lose 50% cargo but survive"

#### 3. Hull Warning System ‚ùå PARTIALLY MISSING
**Status**: No visual warnings, no color changes
**Design**: Need progressive warnings at 75%, 50%, 25%
**Impact**: Players die unexpectedly

**Needs:**
- [ ] Hull warning stages (75%, 50%, 25%)
- [ ] Screen flash red when damaged ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (basic)
- [ ] Hull bar color changes (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí red)
- [ ] Warning sounds for damage
- [ ] Visual damage effects on pod sprite

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Polish & Feel

**Audio Needed:**
- [ ] Drilling sounds (vary by hardness)
- [ ] Material collection sounds
- [ ] Warning beeps/alarms
- [ ] Explosion sound
- [ ] Thrust/engine sound
- [ ] Supply drop sounds (countdown, rocket, impact)

#### 5. Material Collection Feedback ‚ùå MISSING
**Status**: No feedback when collecting materials
**Design**: Different feedback based on material rarity
**Impact**: Collecting rare materials feels unrewarding

**Needs:**
- [ ] Small popup showing material name + value
- [ ] Rare gem: Screen flash + dramatic sound
- [ ] Exotic material: Full-screen flash + lore snippet
- [ ] First discovery bonus notification

#### 6. Run Summary Screen ‚ùå MISSING
**Status**: Just shows sell dialog with list
**Design**: Need comprehensive post-run statistics
**Impact**: Players don't see their accomplishments

**Needs:**
- [ ] Show after returning to surface
- [ ] Display depth reached
- [ ] Display total cargo value
- [ ] Display best finds (most valuable materials)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Differences from Design

### Things Implemented Differently

1. **Supply Drop System** ‚úÖ CORRECT
   - **Design**: Capacity system with 5-20 items per drop, per-item limits
   - **Implementation**: Fully matches SUPPLY_DROP_SYSTEM.md
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Correct as implemented

2. **Prestige System** ‚úÖ CORRECT
   - **Design**: Core extraction ‚Üí prestige option ‚Üí reset
   - **Implementation**: Matches design, just completed
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Correct as implemented

3. **Return to Surface Mechanic** ‚ö†Ô∏è INCONSISTENT
   - **Design (CLAUDE.md)**: "NO automatic 'return to surface' button. Players must use Emergency Teleporter (consumable item) to return"
   - **Design (FUEL_SYSTEM.md)**: Emergency return at 0 fuel with cargo penalty
   - **Implementation**: Has teleporter button AND surface UI "return" option
   - **Issue**: Conflicts with stated design philosophy
   - **Recommendation**: Need to clarify - should there be an easy "return" or only teleporter consumable?

4. **Engine Speed Upgrade** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
   - **Design**: Listed in MISSING_FEATURES.md as missing
   - **Implementation**: Fully implemented in game
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Was incorrectly listed as missing

5. **Consumables** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
   - **Design**: All 5 consumable types
   - **Implementation**: All 5 fully functional with UI buttons
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Was incorrectly listed as high priority missing

## üóìÔ∏è Development Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Core Proof): 70% complete
  - ‚úÖ Core systems done
  - ‚ùå Warnings/feedback needed (2-3 days)
  - ‚ùå Polish pass needed (3-5 days)

- **Phase 2** (Upgrade Loop): Not started (1-2 weeks)

- **Phase 3** (Prestige): 90% complete ‚úÖ
  - Just completed main implementation
  - Minor polish needed

- **Phase 4** (Polish): Not started (1 week)

- **Phase 5** (Second Planet): Not started (1-2 weeks)

## üìù Notes

**Current State**:
- Strong foundation with all core systems working
- Prestige system just completed successfully
- Supply drop system fully functional
- **Critical Gap**: Missing warning/feedback systems that make failure feel fair
- **Critical Gap**: Missing emergency return system (breaks design intent)
- Need polish pass for feel (particles, sound, haptics)

**Biggest Risks**:
1. No fuel warnings = players frustrated by sudden failure
2. No emergency return = 100% cargo loss too punishing vs design (50% penalty)
3. No audio/haptics = game feels flat
4. No hazards = gameplay repetitive

**Positive Progress**:
- Supply drop system adds strategic depth ‚úÖ
- Prestige system creates long-term hook ‚úÖ
- All consumables working creates interesting decisions ‚úÖ
- Cargo auto-drop working smoothly ‚úÖ

**Recommendation**: Focus on warning systems and emergency return before adding more features. These are breaking core game feel right now.
